# HWID Checker

## Overview
A application built using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) in C#. This allows users to fetch and display their system hardware information, including motherboard, processor, storage-devices, network adapters, and graphics cards.

Additionally, it save this information into a CSV file.

I WILL SAY that this is just a CHECKER at the moment.
This does include any '*HWID spoofing*' functionality.
The '*spoof*' logic is yet to be implemented. 

## Features

  - Motherboard
